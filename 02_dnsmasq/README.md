# The Setup for dnsmasq

## The Goal

In [the last step](../01_nginx/), we configured nginx to listen on ports 8080
and 8443 of our loopback interface. The only problem is that the TLDs we want
to use (`.devel` and `.staging`) are completely made up. We need to make
anything that ends in `.devel` or `.staging` point at our loopback, so that
the DNS names we set up for our SSL certificate will work, among other things.

## The Install

    brew install dnsmasq
    cp dnsmasq.conf /usr/local/etc
    sudo cp -fv /usr/local/opt/dnsmasq/*.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
    sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/homebrew.mxcl.dnsmasq.plist

If you want your custom TLDs to be visible to Docker containers, you'll want to
do the following, as well:

    cp dnsmasq-docker.conf /usr/local/etc
    sudo cp -fv devel.local.dnsmasq.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons
    sudo chown root /Library/LaunchDaemons/devel.local.dnsmasq.plist
    sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/devel.local.dnsmasq.plist

This starts a second instance of dnsmasq listening on the `vboxnet0` interface,
which returns an alternate IP that works inside docker containers to resolve
against your machine's configuration, once it sees that the file /tmp/.b2d has
been modified. We'll cover doing this in [the Docker section](../05_docker/).

## The Configuration

There's not a ton to do on this step, really. The configuration is mostly
handled by the `dnsmasq.conf` we placed in `/usr/local/etc`. However, we do need
to tell OS X to use our dnsmasq server to resolve the TLDs we configured. That's
as easy as:

    echo nameserver 127.0.0.1 | \
      sudo tee /etc/resolver/devel /etc/resolver/staging

Note: In macOS Sierra, the resolver folder doesn't exist so it will need to be created before you can run this.
    sudo mkdir -v /etc/resolver


Now, when OS X tries to look up anything at either of these two TLDs, it'll use
the local nameserver provided by dnsmasq.

Onward to [pfctl configuration](../03_pfctl/)!
